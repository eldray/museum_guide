    "description": "Conceptual art, sometimes simply called conceptualism, was one of several 20th-century art movements that arose during the 1960s, emphasizing ideas and theoretical practices rather than the creation of visual forms. The term was coined in 1967 by the artist Sol LeWitt, who gave the new genre its name in his essay �Paragraphs on Conceptual Art,� in which he wrote, �The idea itself, even if not made visual, is as much a work of art as any finished product.�"
