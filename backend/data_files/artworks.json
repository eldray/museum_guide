      "artist": 5,
      "description": "One of the most iconic works in all of art history, Michelangelo�s David had its origins in a larger project to decorate the buttresses of Florence�s great cathedral, the Duomo, with a group of figures taken from the Old Testament. The David was one, and was actually begun in 1464 by Agostino di Duccio. Over the next two years, Agostino managed to rough out part of the huge block of marble hewn from the famous quarry in Carrara before stopping in 1466. (No one knows why.) Another artist picked up the slack, but he, too, only worked on it briefly. The marble remained untouched for the next 25 years, until Michelangelo resumed carving it in 1501. He was 26 at the time. When finished, the David weighed six tons, meaning it couldn�t be hoisted to the cathedral�s roof. Instead, it was put on display just outside to the entrance to the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence�s town hall. The figure, one of the purest distillations of the High Renaissance style, was immediately embraced by the Florentine public as a symbol of the city-state�s own resistance against the powers arrayed against it. In 1873, the David was moved to Accademia Gallery, and a replica was installed in its original location.",

      "by_artist": "Gian Lorenzo Bernini",
      "description": "Acknowledged as an originator of the High Roman Baroque style, Gian Lorenzo Bernini created this masterpiece for a chapel in the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria. The Baroque was inextricably linked to the Counter-Reformation through which the Catholic Church tried to stem the tide of Protestantism surging across 17th-century Europe. Artworks like Bernini�s was part of the program to reaffirm Papal dogma, well served here by Bernini�s genius for imbuing religious scenes with dramatic narratives. Ecstasy is a case in point: Its subject�Saint Teresa of �vila, a Spanish Carmelite nun and mystic who wrote of her encounter with an angel�is depicted just as the angel is about to plunge an arrow into her heart. Ecstasy�s erotic overtones are unmistakable, most obviously in the nun�s orgasmic expression and the writhing fabric wrapping both figures. An architect as all as an artist, Bernini also designed the setting of the Chapel in marble, stucco and paint.",

      "description": "While Impressionist master Edgar Degas is best known as a painter, he also worked in sculpture, producing what was arguably the most radical effort of his oeuvre. Degas fashioned The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer out of wax (from which subsequent bronze copies were cast after his death in 1917), but the fact that Degas dressed his eponymous subject in an actual ballet costume (complete with bodice, tutu and slippers) and wig of real hair caused a sensation when Dancer debuted at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition of 1881 in Paris. Degas elected to cover most of his embellishments in wax to match the rest of girl�s features, but he kept the tutu, as well as a ribbon tying backing her hair, as they were, making the figure one of the first examples of found-object art. Dancer was the only sculpture that Degas exhibited in his lifetime; after his death, some 156 more examples were found languishing in his studio.",

Commissioned for a park in the city of Calais (where a year-long siege by the English in 1346 was lifted when six town elders offered themselves up for execution in exchange for sparing the population), The Burghers eschewed the format typical of monuments at the time: Instead of figures isolated or piled into a pyramid atop a tall pedestal, Rodin assembled his life-size subjects directly on the ground, level with the viewer.",

Also in MoMA�s collection, it depicted a guitar, a subject Picasso often explored in painting and collage, and in many respects, Guitar transferred collage�s cut and paste techniques from two dimensions to three. It did the same for Cubism, as well, by assembling flat shapes to create a multifaceted form with both depth and volume. Picasso�s innovation was to eschew the conventional carving and modeling of a sculpture out of a solid mass. Instead, Guitar was fastened together like a structure. This idea would reverberate from Russian Constructivism down to Minimalism and beyond. Two years after making the Guitar in cardboard, Picasso created this version in snipped tin.Recommended",

He could also be described as a radical conservative, though it should be remembered that even avant-garde contemporaries like Picasso produced works in an adaptation of Neo-Classical style after World War I. Maillol�s subject was the female nude, and in L�Air, he�s created a contrast between the material mass of his subject, and the way she appears to be floating in space�balancing, as it were, obdurate physicality with evanescent presence.",

      "description": "Born in Romania, Brancusi was one of most important sculptors of early-20th century modernism�and indeed, one of the most important figures in the entire history of sculpture. A sort of proto-minimalist, Brancusi took forms from nature and streamlined them into abstract representations. His style was influenced by the folk art of his homeland, which often featured vibrant geometric patterns and stylized motifs. He also made no distinction between object and base, treating them, in certain cases, as interchangeable components�an approach that represented a crucial break with sculptural traditions. This iconic piece is a portrait of his model and lover, Margit Pog�ny, a Hungarian art student he met in Paris in 1910. The first iteration was carved in marble, followed by a plaster copy from which this bronze was made. The plaster itself was exhibited in New York at the legendary Armory Show of 1913, where critics mocked and pilloried it. But it was also the most reproduced piece in the show. Brancusi worked on various versions of Mlle Pogany for some 20 years.",

As a woman artist who often referred to female sexuality, she was also a precursor of Feminist Art. Kusama�s work is often characterized by hallucinogenic patterns and repetitions of forms, a proclivity rooted in certain psychological conditions�hallucinations, OCD�she�s suffered since childhood. All of these aspects of Kusuma�s art and life are reflected in this work, in which an ordinary, upholstered easy chair is unnervingly subsumed by a plaguelike outbreak of phallic protuberances made of sewn stuffed fabric.",

True to the name Warhol had given his studio�the Factory�the artist hired carpenters to work a kind of assembly line, nailing together wooden boxes in the shape of cartons for various products, including Heinz Ketchup, Kellogg�s Corn Flakes and Campbell�s Soup, as well Brillo soap pads. He then painted each box a color matching the original (white in the case of Brillo) before adding the product name and logo in silkscreen. Created in multiples, the boxes were often shown in large stacks, effectively turning whatever gallery they were in into a high-cultural facsimile of a warehouse. Their shape and serial production was perhaps a nod to�or parody of�the then-nascent Minimalist style. But the real point of Brillo Box is how its close approximation to the real thing subverts artistic conventions, by implying that there�s no real difference between manufactured goods and work from an artist�s studio.",

Sited along a major highway, Angel soars to 66 feet in height and spans 177 feet in width from wingtip to wingtip.

She fiercely questions monumentality and the masculine prerogative that goes with it. Harrison creates the bulk of her sculptures by stacking and arranging blocks or slabs of Styrofoam, before covering them in a combination of cement and painterly flourishes. The cherry on top is some sort of found object, either alone or in combination with others. A prime example is this mannequin atop an elongated, paint-splashed form. Wearing a cape, and a backwards-facing Abraham Lincoln mask, the work sends up the great man theory of history with its evocation of the Ancient World�s conqueror standing tall on a clown-colored rock.",
