This Dutch painter is famous for not only his paintings but his life story as well. Van Gogh did not live an easy life. In fact, he did not get to experience the success of his career.People only came to appreciate his works after he passed away. While he was still alive, he struggled with his mental health. He suffered from psychotic episodes. Also, he wasn?t in the best shape physically. He often drank and did not eat well. In a fit of rage, he cut off a part of his left ear.Despite this, he made amazing art. People saw him as a misunderstood genius and a tortured artist. His paintings are some of the most expensive in the world.",

Starting out as a commercial artist, he brought the ethos of advertising into fine art, even going so far as to say, Making money is art.
